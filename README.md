# Giftastic
This app uses the Giphy API to find any Gifs on your favorite TV Shows.

## How it Works

What's your favorite TV Show?

1. There are a list of buttons provided with TV shows titles.
2. Click on any of the buttons provided and a list of 10 still Gifs will appear.
3. If you click on any of the gifs the will animate, then click it again and it will become still again.
4. You can add your own tv show in the search box provided.
5. A button will be created with the TV show you entered.
6. You can then click that button and gifs from your entered show will appear!
